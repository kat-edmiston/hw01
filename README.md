# Bio of Kat Edmiston

## A bit about me...
My Name is Kat Edmiston, and I'm a rising fourth year. I'm getting a [joint BA/MA with the MAPSS program!](https://mapss.uchicago.edu/) I'm majoring in [Law, Letters, and Society](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/lawlettersandsociety/) and at least one of me theses will look at the relationship between loosening charter school regulations and school performance through non-traditional metrics (i.e. not testing).

My interests include:
* Baking
  + (Primarily cookies and pastries, though I'm attempting croissants this week.)
* Research into alternative education metrics
* Yoga
* Watching dumb competition shows, like:

I have eclectic interests...

Even though I've learned a bit of Python in the past, I'm hoping this class will take me to the next level with my research.

The most important thing to know about me is...  
**I love a challenge!**  
*and this class certainly seems like one...*
